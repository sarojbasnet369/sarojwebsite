        <h3> <strong>Online Engineering entrance preparation sites/institutes in Nepal </strong></h3>
        <p class="published"><em>Published on October 16, 2024</em></p>
 	<p class="author"><strong>Author: Saroj Basnet (Rank 3, IOE BE/BArch Entrance 2077)</strong></p>
        

    <p>It takes at least three months to receive the results of the grade XII annual exam. During this period, students can utilize their time for various purposes, such as engaging in creative activities, learning new skills, pursuing hobbies, or preparing for the entrance exams of various educational programs. Different colleges and universities conduct entrance exams before admitting students to their Bachelor's programs. </p>
