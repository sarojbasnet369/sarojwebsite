            <ul>
                <li>I am not affiliated with any political party, so I am not bound to follow orders from any higher authority.</li>
                <li>As an independent candidate, no one above or below my position can force me to engage in or facilitate any wrongdoing.</li>
                <li>To ensure accountability, I will personally inspect and monitor how and where the budget is being utilized.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlight">üëâ Transparent Budget Allocation Plan:</span></p>

            <h3>2. Transforming Pulchowk into Nepal‚Äôs Startup Hub</h3>
            <p>Our team of four took our 4th-year project idea to <strong>The Startup Network</strong>, where we had the opportunity to meet various business leaders, held a virtual meeting with the CEO of Paytm, and participated in the <strong>Nepal-India Startup Connect</strong> event organized by the <strong>Embassy of India</strong>. This experience provided us with invaluable insights into business, investment, and the startup ecosystem.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">üëâ Making Pulchowk Nepal‚Äôs Startup Hub:</span></p>
            <ul>

                <li>The FSU will foster an environment that encourages and promotes startup culture.</li>

            <h3>3. Establishing a Research & Innovation Center at Pulchowk</h3>
            <p>Every year, numerous projects and research initiatives are launched at Pulchowk, but many are abandoned or left incomplete due to a lack of continuity. Through the FSU, we will connect students with similar interests to ensure these projects continue and reach their full potential. By providing continuous support and funding, we can drive long-term innovation and create impactful solutions.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a <strong>Knowledge-Sharing Program</strong> will be introduced to foster collaboration between Bachelor, Master‚Äôs, and PhD students. This initiative will enhance thesis and research cooperation, allowing Bachelor students to be included as <strong>3rd or 4th authors</strong> in research papers. This will provide undergraduates with valuable learning experiences from senior researchers, promoting a stronger research and innovation culture.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">üîπ Key Initiatives:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collaborative Research ‚Äì Connecting students with shared interests to work together on research projects.</li>
                <li>Continuous Support ‚Äì Providing funding and resources to prevent projects from being abandoned.</li>

            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>In political parties, candidates must follow orders from upper leaders to secure a ticket. This means they are liable to those above them, not just the students. Their decisions are often influenced by party agendas rather than student needs. No matter how capable a person is, if they are in a party, they must follow orders from above.</p>
            <p>However, an independent representative is free from such pressure. They are not controlled or answerable to any higher political figures‚Äîonly to the students who elect them. This allows them to make independent decisions that truly benefit the student body.</p>
            <p>We are striving to make the system work correctly‚Äîfairly and impartially‚Äîwithout bias towards political allies, relatives, or favoritism. Decisions should be based on merit and need, as they rightfully should be. </p>
            <p> <strong>Students should have the right to choose their own representative‚Äîone who prioritizes them over party politics.</p> </strong>
            <p>Be the Change. Vote for a Transparent and Student-First FSU!</p>
