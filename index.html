        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Saroj Basnet, a 4th-year Mechanical Engineering student and an independent candidate running for Treasurer in the FSU Elections at IOE Pulchowk Campus.
</p>
        <p>Since my first year, I have been creating videos to highlight student issues, raising awareness about the problems we face on campus. But now, I don’t just want to talk about the issues—I want to solve them.</p>

    <p>✅ <strong>Opportunities for All</strong> – More scholarships, research funding, and startup support.</p>
    <p>✅ <strong>No Party Influence</strong> – I answer only to the students, not to party leaders.</p>

            <h2>The Difference</h2>
            <p>In political parties, candidates must follow orders from upper leaders to secure a ticket. This means they are liable to those above them, not just the students. Their decisions are often influenced by party agendas rather than student needs. No matter how capable a person is, if they are in a party, they must follow orders from above.</p>
            <p>However, an independent representative is free from such pressure. They are not controlled or answerable to any higher political figures—only to the students who elect them. This allows them to make independent decisions that truly benefit the student body.</p>
            <p>We are striving to make the system work correctly—fairly and impartially—without bias towards political allies, relatives, or favoritism. Decisions should be based on merit and need, as they rightfully should be. </p>
            <p> <strong>Students should have the right to choose their own representative—one who prioritizes them over party politics.</p> </strong>
            <p>Be the Change. Vote for a Transparent and Student-First FSU!</p>
